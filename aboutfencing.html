  <h2 style="text-align: center">ABOUT FENCING</h2>

  Fencing means different things to different people. For some it is just a fun hobby, a form of exercise, or a chance to take part in the social life of a club. Others take it very seriously, training several times a week and going to competitions on most weekends. Ages range from under ten to over eighty; it is a lifelong sport for men and women, where an experienced seventy-year-old is almost certain to beat a beginner of twenty. It is one of the largest sports worldwide in terms of participation, and clubs can be found all over the world. </p>

  <p>Fencing has evolved from centuries of duelling into an extremely safe sport. The weapons used are blunt-ended, and fencers wear protective clothing which is reinforced to prevent injuries.</p>

  <p>The rules of modern fencing were formalised in France and its governing body, the Fédération Internationale d’Escrime (FIE), is based in Switzerland. The FIE is responsible for standards and for the competition rules used at every level, from Schoolgirls and Schoolboys Championships to the Olympic Games.</p>

  <h3>Weapons</h3>

  <p>The sport of fencing consists of three distinct disciplines: foil, épée, and sabre. Fencers often specialise in just one weapon. The weapons differ in the way they are used to score hits: in foil and épée, only a thrust with the point of the weapon counts, whereas in sabre a hit can also be made by the side of the blade. </p>

  <p>A hit must arrive on the correct target area. In foil, this is the trunk of the body; the limbs and head are 'off target'. In épée, the target is the whole body including the head, while in sabre the target is everything from the waist up. </p>

  <p>The timing of the hit which scores is also different. In épée, it is simply whichever hit arrives first, but in foil and sabre it is the hit made by the action that started first. In these two weapons the Referee determines which action had 'right of way', i.e. which started first. </p>

  <h3>Starting Fencing</h3>
  <p>You can start fencing by joining a club, where you will be able to take lessons from a coach and spar with other members. The Clubs page lists all of the fencing clubs in the country, including their contact details and training times. Some clubs run special courses or separate training sessions aimed at beginners.</p>

  <p>When you join a club, you may find yourself learning one weapon initially (frequently foil), and then switching to one of the others if you wish. In all three weapons, you will learn footwork, various attacks, defensive parries, and counterattacking ripostes. No matter which weapon you eventually choose, there is an endless amount to learn, and also lifelong opportunities to meet and compete with all kinds of people, strike up enduring friendships, and have a lot of fun.</p>

  <p>For your first night, all you need are a t-shirt, tracksuit bottoms (or similar), and a pair of trainers. Clubs provide loan equipment for beginners, but most fencers later go on to buy their own gear for training and competitions.  </p>

  <h3>Equipment</h3>

  <p>The first items you should consider purchasing are a mask, jacket, glove and plastron. Sports shops in Ireland do not carry fencing equipment but you can purchase online through one of the major fencing suppliers (we have a supplier list in our links section). Clubs and coaches often have arrangements in place with various suppliers, so you should check with them before committing yourself to any major purchases.</p>
